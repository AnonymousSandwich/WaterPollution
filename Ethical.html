	<p class=head><b>Argument</b></p>
	<p>If water pollution is destroying the lives of people who do not cause it, then an injustice is being committed against them.</p>
	<p>Large companies cause water pollution by dumping their waste into water supplies making it undrinkable without being affected</p>
	<p>by it. This is an injustice against the people who rely on that water.</p>

		<p class=head><b>UN Articles</b></p>
		<p class=head><b>Article 25</b></p>
		<p><i>(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food,</p>
		<p>clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness,</p>
		<p>disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. (2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled</p>
		<p>to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>Water is the most essential component of life and the well being and health of a person or family cannot be guaranteed without water.</p>
		<p>The availability of clean water is out of the average person's control because they rely on the environment and larger companies and</p>
		<p>agencies to provide it for them.</p>
		<br>
		<p class=head><b>Article 2</b></p>
		<p><i>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race,</p>
		<p>colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no</p>
		<p>distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a</p>
		<p>person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>Parts of the Declaration refer to the rights to quality of life, which would be affected by the ability to access clean water.</p>
		<br>
		<p class=head><b>Article 5</b></p>
		<p><i>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>While the pollution of water is not necessarily torture, nor has as significant of an effect on people. It is cruel to those who</p>
		<p>drink and/or live near or in it. It is not necessary nor beneficial.</p>
		<br>
		<p class=head><b>Article 7</b>
		<p><i>All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal</p>
		<p>protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>All people should have the shared right to safe water, to give one community safe water, and the other dirty water, the state is</p>
		<p>not providing equal to protection to both communities.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=phil>
		<p class=head></b>Philosipher</b></p>
		<p>John Locke once argued that God had "given the world to man in common," and thus wanted man to make use of it best. Every man was</p>
		<p>given the resources and had equal right to it, yet ownership rights were shifted once somebody altered or developed that resource.</p>
		<p>In the case of large oil companies, one would imagine that by Locke's logic, the detrimental effects on water would be "owned" by</p>
		<p>those companies, and they would feel the disadvantage of their development. However, those working in large oil companies are not the</p>
		<p>ones negatively affected by the water, and in fact often benefit from these conditions. Therefore, the actions of these companies are</p>
		<p>unequal and disrupt the responsibilities of resource ownership.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=cst>
		<p class=head>Catholic Social Teaching</p>
		<p>Catholic tradition insists that we show our respect for the Creator by our stewardship of creation. Care for the earth is not just</p>
		<p>an Earth Day slogan, it is a requirement of our faith. We are called to protect people and the planet, living our faith in relationship</p>
		<p>with all of God's creation. This environmental challenge has fundamental moral and ethical dimensions that cannot be ignored.</p>
		<br>
		<p>This Catholic Social Teaching states that me must be stewards of the earth. Water is the majority of the earth and is a vital element</p>
		<p>to all forms of life. As Stewards of the earth we must take care of water, and activly work to not pollute and if not, then clean up water</p>
		<p>pollution left behind by others.</p>
