			<p class="indent">		What has become a sparse speck of land in rural Alaska used to be a wide coastal</p>
			<p>Native American tribe of Kivalina, which now looks as though it is a shadow of</p>
			<p>its former self. After generations of  nomadic life, the townsfolk have been forced</p>
			<p>to settle, despite the tremendous hurdles they face due to climate change and</p>
			<p>water pollution. This small tribehas only ten houses with running water, yet even</p>
			<p>then the owners of those houses must empty pots of sewage in a landfill to avoid</p>
			<p>contamination.</p>
			<p class="indent">		The tribe of Kivalina consists of a small strip of land on the coast.</p>
			<p>This sandy strip becomes ever-smaller, however, due to the rising water levels</p>
			<p>caused by climate change. The tribe attempts to shore up this issue by creating</p>
			<p>a sandbag barrier which has done little, if anything, to protect them. At this</p>
			<p>point, the villagers would leave the area in a heartbeat, however, due to schools</p>
			<p>set up by the Bureau of Indian affairs, the Natives are bound there, as anyone who</p>
			<p>left could face imprisonment and loss of their children, making escape effectively</p>
			<p>impossible.</p>
			<p class="indent">		The tribe of Kivalina attempted to strike back at the issues they</p>
			<p>faced by suing Exxonmobil, Chevron, BP, and a multitude of other oil and energy</p>
			<p>organizations on the grounds that the effects of the environment that were harming</p>
			<p>the village were the fault of these companies. The court ruled against Kivalina,</p>
			<p>stating that an issue of this scale would need to be fixed with legislation, as a</p>
			<p>correlation between the companies activities and Kivalina’s struggles could not be</p>
			<p>confirmed. The tribe decided to appeal, yet the verdict did not change.</p>
			<p class="indent">		The rising water levels were just one of the tribe’s major struggles. Water found </p>
			<p>in the area of Kivalina had been contaminated with a sort of <q>orange goo</q>. There was </p>
			<p>initial speculation as to whether the goo could be rust particles or fungal spores.</p>
			<p>This made many areas in the tribe unsafe to drink from or swim in, for fear of</p>
			<p>contamination. </p>
			<p class="indent">		To this day, the members of Kivalina have not been adequately</p>
			<p>helped, and must rely on hope. Despite doing no harm, the United States has</p>
			<p>largely turned a blind eye to theirstruggles and the struggles of similar tribes.</p>
			<p>One village member stated that <q>We're United States citizens. We're the taxpayers.</p>
			<p>We have military that serve in the Iraq war. So we're part of United States. If</p>
			<p>we're being wiped out, you know, who's going to replace us?</q></p>
